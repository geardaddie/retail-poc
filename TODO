X: Consider versioning in the API
TODO: Check Content Type and Accept
TODO: Consider adding Bunyan Logging to replace Console

PLAN FOR TONIGHT:

X Build out failing tests
O invert the external service calls and the DB (it's OK for DB to be king)
X Externalize Config
- Refactor out call to External Service as service
  - work promises in?
- Develop Readme
- Replace Console logging with Bunyan
- Consider Swagger
